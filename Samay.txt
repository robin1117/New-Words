thank you man I am actually a professor of logic I teach logic at the University of Science so this guy goes what what
the hell is that what is logic so he goes logic you know is is a subject where you take some information and then
you produce some other information by a set of inferences(अनुमान) you know what let me just give you an example do you have a
dog house so this guy goes yeah I have a dog house he goes that means logically you have a dog this guy goes yeah I have
a dog he's like if you have a dog you probably have a family he's like yeah I have a family he's like if you have a
family it means you have Wife and Kids he goes yeah I do have Wife and Kids he goes that means you're a heterosexual

Somebody That I Used To Know 
now and then I think of when we were togethe

told myself that you were right for me 
but felt so lonely in your company 
but that was love , and it's an ache(दर्द) I still remember

you can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
like resignation to the end, always the end

so when we found that we could not make sense
well, you said that we would still be friends
but I will admit that i was glad it was over

but you didn't have to cut me off
make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
and i don't even need your love
but you treat me like a stranger, and that feels so rough

No, you didn't have to stoop(गिर) so low 
have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that, though 
now you`re just somebody that I used to know 


Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over 
but had me believing it was always something that I had done 

and i don`t wanna live that way 
reading into every word you say
you said that you could let it go 
and I wouldn't catch you hung(लटकना) up on
somebody that you used to know


envision(कल्पना करना)

life is meaning happy and if you can`t happy it is better to die than a miserable(दुखी) life

And then because I became curious what it would feel like
to be fully immersed in something like this,

which we decided to put to good use.
It's like a weighted blanket on every surface of your body.

Now that it was tested and ready, in my ongoing quest(खोज) to be the favorite uncle, I decided to surprise my nephew with it.

if you're new here, you should know that my approach
to science is similar to velociraptor hunting patterns.

Admittedly, the analogy breaks down a little at the end

But if you promise to hang with me for the next two minutes, I promise to try and walk the delicate line between trying to make things simple to understand,
without oversimplifying or being condescending.
